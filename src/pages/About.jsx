                      Our Founding Story
                    </h1>

                    <p className='text-richblack-500 mt-6'>
                    Our e-learning platform was born out of a 
                    shared vision and passion for transforming education. 
                    It all began with a group of educators, technologists,
                     and lifelong learners who recognized the need for accessible,
                      flexible, and high-quality learning opportunities in a rapidly
                       evolving digital world.
                   </p>

                    <p className='text-richblack-500 mt-3 '>
                      As experienced educators ourselves,
                     we witnessed firsthand the limitations and challenges of traditional education systems.
                      We believed that education should not be confined to
                       the walls of a classroom or restricted by geographical
                        boundaries. We envisioned a platform that could bridge
                         these gaps and empower individuals from all walks of
                          life to unlock their full potential.

                    With this vision in mind,

                    tirelessly to develop a robust and intuitive
                    platform that combines cutting-edge technology
